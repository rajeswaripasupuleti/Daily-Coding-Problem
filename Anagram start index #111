This problem was asked by Google.

Given a word W and a string S, find all starting indices in S which are anagrams of W.

For example, given that W is "ab", and S is "abxaba", return 0, 3, and 4.

'''

def isAnagram(w,s):
    if(all(x in s for x in w) and len(w)==len(s)):
        return True 
    else:
        return False
        
w=input()
s=input()

k=[i for i in range(len(s)) for j in range(i+1,len(s)+1) if(isAnagram(w,s[i:j]))]
print(k)
