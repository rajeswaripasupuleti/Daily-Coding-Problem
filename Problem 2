'''
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

    k=[] # an empty list to store output list
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        
        # Using list slicing skip the ith index element
        #Reduce function applies the given function to the provided iterable object.
        
        product=functools.reduce(lambda x,y:x*y,arr[:i]+arr[i+1:])
        k.append(product)
    return k
    
arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
