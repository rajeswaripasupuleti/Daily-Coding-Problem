#Two numbers summing upto K or not
'''
This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

'''
def sumup_k(arr,k):
    #if both i and k-i exists in the list it means the list has a pair whose sum is equals to k.
    for i in arr:
        if(k-i in arr):
            return True
        return False
    
k=int(input())
arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
print(sumup_k(arr,k))
