'''
Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

string=input()
list1=list(map(str,input().split()))
op=[]

for i in list1:
    if(string in i):
        op.append(i)
print(op)
