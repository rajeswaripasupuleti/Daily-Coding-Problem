This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure with the following methods: enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and dequeue, which removes it.

'''
stack1=[]
stack2=[]

def enqueue(x):
    stack1.append(x)

def dequeue():
    if(stack2==[]):
        while(stack1!=[]):
            stack2.append(stack1.pop())
    return stack2.pop()

enqueue(1)
enqueue(2)
enqueue(3)
enqueue(4)
dequeue()
dequeue()
print(stack2[::-1])
