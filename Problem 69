This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.

For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.

You can assume the list has at least three integers.

ar=list(map(int,input().split()))

k=max(prod(i) for i in list(combinations(ar,3)))
print(k)
