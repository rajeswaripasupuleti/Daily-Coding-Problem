This problem was asked by Microsoft.

A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10.

Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.

For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28.
'''

x=19
c=0
n=int(input())
while(c!=n):
    if(sum(int(i) for i in str(x))==10):
        c+=1 
    x+=1
else:
    print(x-1)
