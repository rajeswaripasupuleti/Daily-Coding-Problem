'''Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.'''

def fun(arr):
    # iterate from minimum of array to max of array+1
    for i in range(min(arr),max(arr)+2):
        #Ignore the negative numbers using condition and the number which is not present in list is returned else maximim of array +1  is returned
        if i not in arr and i>0:
            return i
