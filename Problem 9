Good morning!''' Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.'''

arr=list(map(int,input().split()))

l=[arr[0]]

for i in range(1,len(arr),2):
    if(arr[i+1:]!=[]):
        l.append(max(arr[i+1:]))
print(l)
